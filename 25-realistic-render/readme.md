# Chapter 25 - Realistic Render 

## Introduction 
In this lesson, we will learn many techniques to improve how our model looks once rendered in Three.js. Note that some techniques may impact performance. 

## Key Learning Points 
- `MeshBasicMaterial` does not respond to light. Use `MeshStandardMaterial`
- Changing light intensities from default scale to a physically correct scale
- The benefit of this is if you import a model from blender with a light, result will be the same 
- The model imported is not compressed and thus do not need a draco loader to import
