## Key Learning Points 
- create own physics with some maths and `Raycaster`
- or use a library if you want realistic physics
- 3D physics libraries; Ammo.js, Cannon.js, Oimo.js
- Physijs combines three.js and physics 
- cannon.js is the one use in this lesson `npi i cannon`
- create a 3D world and a 2D physics world
