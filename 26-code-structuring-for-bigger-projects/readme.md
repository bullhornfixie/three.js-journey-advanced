# Chapter 26 - Code Structuring For Bigger Projects 

![alt text](./static/screenshot-lesson-25.png)

## Introduction 
To this point, all the exercises have been small enough to fit into a single JavaScript file without struggling too much. We've separated the different parts of our code by using block comments, and we've scrolled a lot.

But real life projects tend to have much more code and this lesson shows us how to structure the code using concepts like classes and modules. 

## Key Learning Points 


### Modules 
- Used to break down large chunks of javaScript into smaller pieces 
- Keep it simple but exporting one thing per file 

### Webpack 
- It is a BUILD PROCESS
- It is taking your files, running through a conversion and spitting them out into something browser understands 
- It has features such as `tree shaking` removing dead code 
- Next.js uses webpack
